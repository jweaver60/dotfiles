# Definiv Dotfiles

This is the beginning of my dotfiles repo. 

### Vim/MacVim
--------------
The `vim` directory contains the `vimrc` and `gvimrc` files that will need to be symlinked to your user directory (this will be
automated later).

### ZSH/Bash
--------------
The `bash` and `zsh` directories contain `.bashrc` and `.zshrc` files that will need to be symlinked into your user directory.
Use whichever one applies to your preferred shell (or both).

### Git
--------------
Right now the `git` directory only contains the `gitignore_global` until I can find a way to hide `.gitcongfig` credentials. This 
will need to be symlinked to your user directory.

### RVM
--------------
The `rvm` directory contains my basic `rvmrc` file that needs to be symlinked to your user directory.
